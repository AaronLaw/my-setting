Purpose of Pi:
========
1. Help to maintace the daily operation of hobototes (e.g. When we travel around the world, we need a small-enough computer for operation.).
2. As a device to operate all-day-long with low power consumption. (verse the power a notebook needs)
3. Runs the hobototes-data-centric apps on it. (To free my notebook from always-turning-on. Moving django project to it.)
4. Runs as a host to share files. (BTSync, verse Dropbox)

Raspberry for hobototes.
