# Getting Laravel up


First, install [Composer] (https://getcomposer.org/download/):

    curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

You can place this file anywhere you wish. If you put it in your `PATH`, you can access it globally. On unixy systems you can even make it executable and invoke it without php.

You can run these commands to easily access composer from anywhere on your system:

    curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
    mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
