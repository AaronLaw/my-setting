## On how to learn

http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-way-to-learn-PHP-1

Read things that you need to read and don't worry too much. :)

What is your background? I used to be a CS student, and working in a different field rather than IT-related. However, I love to code.

PHP is ugly, and I taught myself codnig in Python using Django for making web. I don't like PHP's syntax. However, recently, I've got a project using PHP. That is PHP5.4+ and I choose to use a MVC framework called "Laravel".

My approach to learn PHP is learn by doing (with a project that is live and you are using it, such as the Django project, which is on my private network, I am doing.)

Firstly I (and you) should have some basic background about a language, then go to make something real and useful (by the approach, I and you are facing some real problem. For example: how can I increment 21...29 to 30? round() is helpful but it doesn't give me the exact result I want. And I have to do some basic math with it...)

That is, go to read the basic part of doc (on Hypertext Preprocessor), pick up a MVC framework with give you good structure, set a goal to make a real project (weblog system / CMS is a good starting point). When you make the project, you are facing some real problem that you have to solve. Then, go to read the doc of the language and the framework.

Read things that you need to read and don't worry too much. :)

# Getting Laravel up


First, install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/):
    
    curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

You can place this file anywhere you wish. If you put it in your `PATH`, you can access it globally. On unixy systems you can even make it executable and invoke it without php.

You can run these commands to easily access composer from anywhere on your system:

    curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
    mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer

ref:
* http://kejyun.github.io/Laravel-4-Documentation-Traditional-Chinese/docs/quick/
* http://laravel.com/docs/4.2/installation

Now, we can go to install Lavavel.

First, download the Laravel installer using Composer.

    composer global require "laravel/installer=~1.1"

Make sure to place the ~/.composer/vendor/bin directory in your PATH so the laravel executable is found when you run the laravel command in your terminal.

Once installed, the simple laravel new command will create a fresh Laravel installation in the directory you specify. For instance, laravel new blog would create a directory named blog containing a fresh Laravel installation with all dependencies installed. This method of installation is much faster than installing via Composer.

    laravel new blog # ~/.composer/vendor/bin/laravel

ref:
* http://laravel.com/docs/4.2/quick

## Serving Laravel

Typically, you may use a web server such as Apache or Nginx to serve your Laravel applications. If you are on PHP 5.4+ and would like to use PHP's built-in development server, you may use the serve Artisan command:

    php artisan server

It returns an error:

    mcrypt php extension required

Google: php artisan server mcrypt php extension required
* [Laravel.io - Difficulty installing Laravel: Getting error "Mcrypt PHP extension required"](http://laravel.io/forum/02-08-2014-difficulty-installing-laravel-getting-error-mcrypt-php-extension-required)

Check 

    which php
    php --ini
    php -v

use `grep mcrypt` to see if there was `mcrypt` there. Since I have `php5-fpm` install, I go to check it too.

    php -i | grep mcrypt

I see no  `mcrypt` there. I have to install it now. 
Installing php5-mcrypt doesn't automatically enable the module, so I had to enable it manually:

First install php5-mcrypt

    apt-get install php5-mcrypt

Create an auxiliary symlink and enable the module:

    cd /etc/php5/mods-available
    ln -sf ../conf.d/mcrypt.ini . # make a symlink to ini files in mods-available
    php5enmod mcrypt # enable it

Reload the web server

    service apache2 reload
    sudo service php5-fpm restart



And, if you need an isolated development environment, you should try [Laravel Homestead](http://laravel.com/docs/4.2/homestead)

## Create a Blog with Laravel, 2014-10

I mainly learn it from: [Learning Laravel: Simple Laravel Blog: Setting Up & Migrations Part 1](http://learninglaravel.net/simple-laravel-blog-setting-up-migrations-part-1), with the supplementory of [](),  and lookup command and meaning in [the doc of Laravel 4.2](http://laravel.com/docs/4.2/)

(Laravel follows Rails's convention.)

First, create a `blog` project:

    laravel new blog # ~/.composer/vendor/bin/laravel

This will install/copy a set of laravel to a `blog` folder, which is located in the pwd.

(for using github,
    cd blog
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m 'init commit'
    git remote add origin https://github.com/AaronLaw/blog
    git push -u origin master

ref: creating a new project on github
)

Then change the db setting, and `debug=>true` in `blog/app/config/database.php' and `blog/app/config/app.php'. Set `time-zone` to `Asia/Taipei` too.

(ref: 

* Google: laravel Asia/Taipei

    * [Laravel PHP Framework 快速上手指南](http://it.nekounya.com/laravel-php-framework-quick-install-and-config-guide.html)
)


Create post table:

    php artisan migrate:make create_posts_table

Complete the `up()` and `down()` functions in the newly created migration file, which is located at `blog/app/database/migrations/`

    #php
    public function up()
    {
        //
        Schema::create('posts', function($t) {
            $t->increments('id');
            $t->string('title', 200);
            $t->string('slug', 400);
            $t->boolean('draft');
            $t->text('body');
            $t->timestamps();
        }) ;
    }
   
    /**
     * Reverse the migrations.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function down()
    {
        //
        Schema::drop('posts');
    }

Then migrate it:

    php artisan migrate

[#](http://laravel.com/docs/4.2/migrations)

Now, I've created a Posts table, and connect to db.
(part1 is finished.)

## Clone and run my project from Github

To clone my project on local envrionment,

    git clone https://github.com/AaronLaw/Apple-Care-Connect.git

Then `php artisan serve` doesn't work.
Laravel framework generates 3000+ files but `git push` only pushes 60+ files to Github, why? It is because the `vendor` directory is listed in `.gitignore` when the framework generates files.

The cloned framework is broken, some files are missing. We need to fix it:

    composer install

Then the internal server works now. [Which files/directories to ignore in a Laravel 4 project when using version control?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17003253/which-files-directories-to-ignore-in-a-laravel-4-project-when-using-version-cont) (from Google: why git init ignore laravel vendor).

( So you don't add it unnecessarily into version control. Composer can install dependencies onto your production server for you. (`composer install`). Note that composer update will update to latest dependencies and download them while `composer install` will install based on items in `composer.lock`. You should keep `composer.lock` in version control and use `$ composer install` in production to ensure you get the version of software you expect. (Running `composer update` also updates `composer.lock`). –  fideloper Feb 12 at 0:41 )

(As noted in the below comment, you probably want to commit composer.lock in your project. Laravel ignores it by default so the authors of the laravel/laravel package don't accidently impose packages on you.

Your project should include the composer.lock file so you can install packages of stable versions (via composer install instead of composer update) properly in your production environments.)
